"""Turn-end guard for kanban workers.

Kanban workers must end with ``kanban_complete`` or ``kanban_block``. Models
(especially GLM / Qwen families) sometimes narrate the next step
("Let me write the report now") and stop with ``finish_reason=stop`` and no
tool calls. Hermes treats that as a clean exit → ``rc=0`` → dispatcher
``protocol_violation``.

This module is policy-only: when a kanban worker tries to finish without a
terminal board tool, return a bounded synthetic nudge so the conversation
loop continues instead of exiting.

A valid review handoff (``kanban_request_review`` / ``kanban_request_changes``)
is ALSO a terminal state for the originating run — the run row ends and the
dispatcher spawns a successor. The guard must treat those as terminal too, or a
worker that correctly handed off to review keeps getting nudged toward
complete/block and can be driven to mutate the newer run. See
``_TERMINAL_KANBAN_TOOLS``.

# A kanban worker run reaches a terminal board state via any of these tools.
# ``kanban_complete``/``kanban_block`` are the classic terminal transitions, but
# ``kanban_request_review`` and ``kanban_request_changes`` are ALSO terminal for
# the originating run: the tool call ends the run row (outcome=review_requested /
# changes_requested) and the dispatcher immediately claims a successor run. If
# the stop-guard omitted them, an implementation worker that validly handed off
# to review would keep getting nudged to call complete/block — and worse, could
# be driven to mutate the newer review run that the dispatcher already spawned.
# Recognizing the handoff here keeps this session's terminal state anchored to
# ITS OWN run (session_called_kanban_terminal only scans this conversation's
# messages), which is exactly the ownership boundary we need.
